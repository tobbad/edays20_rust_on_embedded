Have look at following [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB6AlE1QuI) and how to write a [Python interpreter (Keynote - David Beazley)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUT386_GKI8&feature=youtu.be). There is a github repo from [Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/py-wasm). Seems Webassembly is an option for smart contracts.
